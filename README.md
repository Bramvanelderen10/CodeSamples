# CodeSamples

This repository showcases some scripts i've written to showcase a general baseline of my programming skills.
The scripts i want to show off are located in
https://github.com/Bramvanelderen10/CodeSamples/tree/master/Assets/CodeSamples

# A* Algorithm

This is my implementation of the A* algorithm. It is showcased in the demo scene with some editor UI for convenience

# Finite State Machine

A Fsm made for the menu management in the game Tribot Smash, but it is an all purpose statemachine.

# Generic Binary Tree

My take on a generic binary tree implementation. Unit tests are included for the tree and the binary tree is used as open list in the A* algorithm

# Isometric Dynamic Camera

An Isometric Camera that can switch camera angles easily by rotating and still keep all the action within the view space by positioning itself correctly based on target and FoV

# Third Person Camera

A third person camera i made for the game Bumble Jumble, it is packaged with the third person controller. The camera bases its position and rotation on the user input and target rotation. The movement controller itself is based on user input and the camera angle.
