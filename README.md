# CodeSamples

This repository showcases some scripts i've written to showcase a general baseline of my programming skills.
The scripts i want to show off are located in
https://github.com/Bramvanelderen10/CodeSamples/tree/master/Assets/CodeSamples

# A* Algorithm

This is my implementation of the A* algorithm. It is showcased in the demo scene with some editor UI for convenience  WIP Needs code clean up and optimisations

# Finite State Machine

A Fsm made for the menu management in the game Tribot Smash, but it is an all purpose statemachine. In the demo scene you can find an example of how it can be used  WIP still needs a demo scene

# Generic Binary Tree

My take on a generic binary tree implementation. It is used as openlist in the A* algorithm as example WIP Fix bug

# Isometric Dynamic Camera

An Isometric Camera that can switch camera angles easily by rotating and still keep all the action within the view space by positioning itself correctly based on target and FoV  WIP Needs code clean up and optimisations

# Third Person Camera

A third person camera i made for the game Bumble Jumble, it is packaged with the third person controller. The camera bases its position and rotation on the user input and target rotation. The movement controller itself is based on user input and the camera angle.  WIP needs code cleanup
